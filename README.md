## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/240708-NET-FS/dogguesser.git
cd dogguesser
```

### 2. Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend application directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd dogguesser-frontend/App
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Backend

Navigate to the backend application directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd dogguesser_backend
dotnet run
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Running the Frontend

Navigate to the \`dogguesser-frontend/App\` folder and start the frontend server:

```bash
cd dogguesser-frontend/App
npm start
```

This will start the frontend on \`http://localhost:5501\`

### 2. Running the Backend

Navigate to the \`dogguesser-backend\` folder and start the backend server:

```bash
cd dogguesser-backend
dotnet run
```

This will start the backend API on \`http://localhost:5153\`.

## Environment Variables

To configure the connection between the frontend and backend, you need to create a \`.env\` file in the \`dogguesser-frontend/App\` directory. The \`.env\` file should contain the following:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:5153/api
```

This environment variable tells the frontend where to send API requests.

### Creating the \`.env\` File

1. Navigate to the \`dogguesser-frontend/App\` directory.
2. Create a file named \`.env\`.
3. Add the following content:

```plaintext
API_URL=http://localhost:5153/api
```
