Dog Guesser Proposal

1. Project Overview
    Dog Guesser is an App that creates a quiz like game where users guess the breed of a dog from random pictures.

2. MVP Features
    Present user with a picture of a dog, while knowing the dogs breed.
    Take a user's answer and compare with the correct breed.
        -The user will be able to type and a drop down will help autofill their answer.
    Quiz should have more than 1 question, ideally 10.
    There should be a table to track users, and scores.
    Have a menu to show scores or play and to login.
        -Scores should show user scores and allow them to compare to all scores.

3. Entity-Relationship Diagram
    User Entity
        UserID (int) 
        Username (string)
        Password (string)

    Score Entity

        UserID (int) (from User Table)

5. Stretch Goals
    Use React
    Multiplayer
    Make it look nice

OTHER
    Preffer to use discord to message about the project. Have a quick check in after class each day (10 mins max).
    We are using a Github Project.
    Don't edit on Main branch. Push Dev to main when we think something significant has changed, like a functioning login.
        -Branch off of Dev for new projects.
        -Merge to dev before pushing to main.
    Try to use common conventions I guess.
